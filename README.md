# MAE290B_WINITER23_Project

This code was the final project of the class MAE290B:Numerical Methods for Differential Equations, where it was taken at UCSD in winter 2023.

In this project, an unsteady 2D, nonhomogeneous heat diffusion equation with zero Dirichlet boundary conditions was solved using the Alternating Direction Implicit (ADI) method.
